# UFO-Ontology-of-Relations

Formalization of Relations in UFO

This repository contains the formalization of the UFO ontology focussing on relations. This formalization was developed on top of UFO's formalization of Endurant Types, available at https://github.com/nemo-ufes/ufo-types.

This file was developed by Daniele Porello with collaboration of Claudenir M. Fonseca.

The Ontology is written in TPTP, to write first-order logic formulas.
