Formalization of Relations in UFO

This repository contains the formalization of the UFO ontology focussing on relations. This formalization was developed on top of UFO's formalization of Endurant Types, available at https://github.com/nemo-ufes/ufo-types.

This file was developed by Daniele Porello with collaboration of Claudenir M. Fonseca.

The Ontology is written in TPTP syntax, to write first-order logic formulas. 



This formalisation is based on a number of articles, e.g. 

Relations in Ontology-Driven Conceptual Modeling. Claudenir M. Fonseca1, Daniele Porello, Giancarlo Guizzardi,Jo√£o Paulo A. Almeida, and Nicola Guarino. ER 2019. 

Reification and Truthmaking Patterns. Guarino, N. et al. ER 2018.

Guizzardi,  G.  et  al.:  Endurant  Types  in  Ontology-Driven  Conceptual  Modeling:  TowardsOntoUML 2.0. ER 2018.
